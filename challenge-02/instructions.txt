I have created a multi stage docker file which has building and running of server application
now created start.sh which does the following operations in the container while running
1.created a sym links to file.txt based on envirnoment variable passed
for example: 

if ENV=dev:
file.txt is sym link of file-dev.txt now due to this file-dev.txt will be read and displayed when http://localhost:8080 is accessed

if ENV=prod
file.txt is sym link of file-prod.txt now due to this file-prod.txt will be read and displayed when http://localhost:8080 is accessed

How to build container image using docker-compose
run bellow command to build and run server
export ENVIRONMENT=dev; sudo -E docker-compose up --build

now based on ENVIRONMENT variable http://localhost will return prod or dev
